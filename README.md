# Project2_phonePe_Pulse_Data_Visualization_and_Exploration-

Through this project we are going to visualize the online transactions done in Phonepe using GUI.

What is Phonepe Pulse?

  +  Phonepe pulse is launched for getting accurate and comprehensive data on digital payment           transaction trends in India
  
  +  Phonepe Pulse webiste mostly shows more than 2000+ transactions done by the consumers on           interactive map of India.
  
  +   Phonepe Pulse is India's first interactive geospatial platform on digital payments.
  
They have shared the transaction data in Github repository for easy access for everyone 
  
### Problem Statement
     
   The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
   various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
   insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
   
   I have created a dashboard to visualize Phonepe pulse Github repository data using Streamlit and Plotly in Python Transactions Analysis: The Transactions data mainly contains the total Transactions count and total amount in each state and district, User Data Analysis: The Users data mainly contains the Registered Users count and App openings via different mobile brands
   
   Here is the demo video of the project I have done.
